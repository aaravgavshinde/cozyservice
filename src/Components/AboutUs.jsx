      <div className='about-content'>In today’s fast-paced world, finding reliable service providers can be a daunting task. Whether it’s an electrician, plumber, or mechanic, traditional methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and quality. CozyService aims to bridge this gap by offering a centralized platform that seamlessly connects users with skilled professionals.
        CozyService will employ advanced recommender systems to suggest the most suitable service providers based on customer preferences, feedback, and geographical location. The platform will feature a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to easily search for, compare, and book services. Initially targeting the city of Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, the project is designed for scalability and can be expanded to other cities in the future. The expected outcome is the creation of a convenient, reliable, and efficient platform that enhances customer satisfaction, improves service quality, and creates new business opportunities.
